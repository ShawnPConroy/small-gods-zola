## Birth

Māui is the son of Taranga, the wife of Makeatutara. He was born premature, and his mother threw him
    into the sea wrapped in a tress of hair from her topknot (tikitiki). This is why Māui's full name is
    Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga. Ocean spirits found and wrapped the child in seaweed and jellyfish to keep
    him safe. His grandfather found him on a beach and adopted him.

## Discovery of his siblings

When Māui became old enough, he travelled to his family's home and found his four brothers,
    Māui-taha, Māui-roto, Māui-pae, and Māui-waho, and his sister, Hina. His brother's didn't know him
    and were very wary of him. (They didn't trust him right away.)

Later at night Māui saw them dancing and being merry. He crept in and sat down behind his brothers,
    and soon Taranga called the children and found a strange child. At first she does not recognise him,
    and attempts to cast him from the house. But he proved he was her son. Māui was then taken in as one
    of the family. Some of the brothers were jealous, but the eldest addressed the others as follows:


<blockquote>
    Never mind; let him be our dear brother. In the days of peace remember the proverb, 'When you are
        on friendly terms, settle your disputes in a friendly way; when you are at war, you must redress
        your injuries by violence.' It is better for us, brothers, to be kind to other people. These are
        the ways by which men gain influence – by laboring for an abundance of food to feed others, by
        collecting property to give to others, and by similar means by which you promote the good of
        others.

## Quest to find his parents

Māui was a shapeshifter. He took on the appearance of a kererū when he went to find his parents in
    the underworld. The white on his chest was his mother's apron.

After Māui performed feats such as transforming himself into different kinds of birds, his brothers
    acknowledged his power and admired him. He became vexed that his mother always left before dawn and
    returned the next night, he one day blocked the entrances and sources of light into their house to
    keep her there, and stole her clothes. With the sun up, he was able to see where she went every day,
    and it turned out that she'd pull a clump of tussock from the ground, and descend a large tunnel to
    the underworld.

Māui was encouraged to follow their mother to the underworld in the form of a kererū. Once he arrived
    there he found a group of people sitting on a patch of grass in a grove of manapau trees, from which
    he dropped berries onto his parents' heads.

Upon Māui transforming back into a human, his mother recognised him as the child who used to live
    with her other sons.


## Māui slows the Sun

Once upon a time, the sun used to travel quickly across the sky, leaving not enough daylight time for
    working and eating. Māui proposed to catch the sun and slow it down. Armed with the jaw-bone of
    Murirangawhenua and a large amount of rope, which is in some tellings made from his sister Hina's
    hair, Māui and his brothers journeyed to the east and found the pit where the sun-god Tama-nui-te-rā
    slept during the night-time. There they tied the ropes into a noose around the pit and built a wall
    of clay to shelter behind. Tama-nui-te-rā was caught in the noose. Māui didn't let him free until he
    surrendered and agreed to travel slowly across the sky.

## Māui fishes up the North Island

Once upon a time, Māui's older brothers always refused to let him come fishing with them. One night,
    he wove for himself a flax fishing line and enchanted it with a karakia to give it strength; to this
    he attached the magic fish-hook made from the jaw-bone that his grandmother Murirangawhenua had
    given him. Then he hid away in the hull of his brothers' waka (canoe). The next morning, when the
    waka was too far from land to return, he emerged from his hiding-place. His brothers would not lend
    him any bait, so he struck himself on the nose and baited the hook with his blood. Māui hauled a
    great fish, known as Hāhau-whenua, up from the depths.


In some stories, this is the North Island of New Zealand is known as Te Ika-a-Māui (The Fish of
    Māui).

When it emerged from the water, Māui left to find a tohunga to perform the appropriate ceremonies and
    prayers, leaving his brothers in charge. If the brothers had listened to Māui, the island would have
    been a level plain, and people would have been able to travel across it with ease. But they did not
    wait for Māui to return, and began to cut up the fish, which writhed in agony, causing it to break
    up into mountains, cliffs and valleys.

In the stories of the Northern Māori, Māui's waka became the South Island, with Banks Peninsula
    marking the place supporting his foot as he pulled up that extremely heavy fish. Besides the
    official name of Te Waipounamu, another Māori name for the South Island is Te Waka-a-Māui, the canoe
    of Māui.

In the stories of the Southern Māori, the South Island is known instead as Te Waka o Aoraki and
    predates Māui's expedition. Māui sailed a canoe called Mahaanui and after he had pulled up the North
    Island (Te Ika a Maui) he left Mahaanui on top of a mountain in the foothills behind what is now
    Ashburton. (That mountain now bears the name Mahaanui, and the coastline between Banks Peninsula and
    the Waitaki River is called Te tai o Mahaanui (the tides of Mahaanui).)

## Māui brings fire to the world

Māui stole fire from the fingernails of Mahuika

Māui wanted to know where fire came from, so one night he went among the villages of his people and
    put all the fires out. Māui's mother Taranga said that someone would have to ask her mother Mahuika,
    the goddess of fire, for more. Māui offered to go and find her. Mahuika lived in a cave in a burning
    mountain at the end of the Earth. She gave Māui one of her burning fingernails to relight the fires.
    But Māui kept putting out the fires on each fingernail until Mahuika became angry and sent magical
    fire to chase Māui.

Māui transformed himself into a hawk to escape, but Mahuika set both land and sea on fire. Māui
    prayed to his great ancestors Tāwhirimātea, god of weather, and Whaitiri-matakataka, goddess of
    thunder, who poured rain to extinguish the fire. Mahuika threw her last nail at Māui, but it missed
    him and flew into some trees including the māhoe and the kaikōmako. Māui brought back dry sticks of
    these trees to his village and showed his people how to rub the sticks together and make fire.

## Irawaru, the first dog

Māui went fishing with his brother-in-law Irawaru. During the expedition, Māui became annoyed with
    him.

In some stories, Māui was jealous of Irawaru's success at fishing, in others, it was because their
    fishing-lines became entangled, in still others, Māui was angry at Irawaru's refusal to give him a
    cloak, or disgusted at Irawaru's greedy nature.

Whatever the provocation, when Māui and Irawaru returned to shore, Māui stretched out Irawaru's limbs
    and transformed him into the first dog. When Hina asked Māui if he had seen her husband, Māui told
    her to call "Moi! Moi!", whereupon Irawaru, in dog form, came running.

## Quest for human immortality and death

After his early exploits, Māui considered himself ready to win immortality for humankind. His father
    tried to dissuade him, predicting that he will fail because of the mistakes in his baptismal
    ceremony. His father says to him, "My son, I know that you are a brave fellow and that you have done
    all things. Yet I am afraid that there is someone who will defeat you."

"Who could that be?" asked Māui.

"Your ancestress Hine-nui-te-pō (Goddess of the Night). You can see her flashing there on the
    horizon."

"Is she as strong as the sun?" asked Māui. "I trapped him and beat him. Is she greater than the sea,
    which is greater than the land? Yet I have dragged land from it. Now let us see whether we will find
    life or death."

His father answered, "You are right, my last-born and the strength of my old age. Go, find your
    ancestress who lives at the side of the sky."

"What does she look like?" asked Māui.

"The red flashing in the western sky comes from her," said the father. "Her body is like a human
    being, but her eyes are greenstone, her hair sea-kelp, and her mouth is like a barracouta's mouth."


Māui, undaunted, set out westward, with his companions, to the home of Hine-nui-te-pō. In some
    stories, his companions are the smallest birds of the forest, the tomtit, the robin, the grey
    warbler and the fantail. In other stories, his companions are his brothers.

The find Hine asleep, and Māui prepares to attack her. He tells his friends, "do not laugh at me.
    Wait until I cut right through her. Then you may laugh as much as you want."

"You will be killed!" was all the companions could say.

"If you laugh I will indeed be killed. But if I pass right through her body I will live, and she will
    die."

Then he readied himself, winding the cord of his battle club tightly around his wrist. As Māui began
    his task, the cheeks of his watching friends puckered with suppressed laughter. Because he was going
    right through her, one of his brothers - or the fantail bird - cannot hold back any longer and burst
    out in laughter. The old lady wakes, opens her eyes, claps her legs together and cuts Māui in two.
    Now Māui has become the first being to die and, because he had failed in his task, all human beings
    are mortal. The goddess keeps her position at the portal to the underworld through which all humans
    must travel.
